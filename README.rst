What is a Twilio endpoint?
----------------------------

When you set up your telephone numbers with Twilio, you must provide a URL for Twilio to hit each time you receive a phone call. This can be a static text file containing TwiML or an application server responding with TwiML etc. 


phox can be used as a basic Twilio endpoint or to start your own applications.

Features
--------

 * Secure - phox ensures API requests are coming from Twilio
